# Food Desert Analysis

Your answers need to be well thought out. Be specific and clear. Do not be vague nor ambiguous.

## Question 1

**What is one way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county` or `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food access?**

> Government officials could use the plot_food_access_by_county and plot_low_access_tracts to analysze the counties that are in greatest need of increased access to food. The plot created by plot_low_access_tracts show all of the areas where food access could be improved, and the plots created by plot_food_access_by_county show the specific counties that are in desparate need of food access improvement, such as Lincoln county.

## Question 2

**What is a limitation or concern with using the plots in this way?**

> Some issues with using plots this way have to do with insiginificant data for some locations, as well as a lack of nuance in what type(s) of food are provided. In this data, only 33 of the 39 counties in Washington are represented, which means about 15% of the counties are untracked, leaving policymakers clueless about the access to food in those areas. Another thing this data fails to take account of is the types of food provided, whether that be healthy, high quality options like that of grocery stores or lower quality options like fast food.
